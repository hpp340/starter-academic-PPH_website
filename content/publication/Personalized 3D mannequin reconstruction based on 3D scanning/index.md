abstract: Personalized customization is a new manufacturing trend in high-end products (e.g. senior
custom clothing).Traditional apparel customization (made-to-measure & bespoken) highly
depends on experienced tailors. A personalized mannequin is essential for apparel customization
using CAD technologies. Currently, a common method of reconstructing mannequin is based on
body measurements or body features. It only preserves the body size instead of preserving the
accurate userâ€™s stature. However, the same human body measurement does not equal to the
same body shape. This may result in an unfit garment for the user. This paper proposes a novel
scanning-based pipeline to reconstruct a personalized mannequin, which preserves both body
size and body stature information. We first capture the body of a user via 3D scanning, and a
statistical body model is fit to the scanned data. This results in a skinned articulated model of
the user. The scanned body is then adjusted to be pose-symmetric via linear blending skinning.
The updated pose-symmetric body is then segmented to initialize the stature symmetry
processing. Finally, a slice-based method is proposed to generate a symmetric 3D mannequin.
The process of apparel customization can be easily digitalized with the help of the proposed
mannequin reconstruction system and the corresponding existing clothing CAD software.
